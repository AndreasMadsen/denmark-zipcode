> A list of zipcodes in denmark and associated information

## Installation

```sheel
npm install denmark-zipcode
```

## Documentation

```javascript
zipcodes = require('denmark-zipcode')
```

On installation this module will download all zipcodes and associated information.
When required it reconstructs a `Map` object, with zipcodes as keys and associated information as values.

```javascript
for (let [zipcode, info] of zipcodes) {
  // zipcode is a number
  zipcode = 2800;

  // info is an object
  info = {
    zipcode: 2800,
    city: 'Kgs. Lyngby',
    province: null,
    communes: [
      { id: '0157', name: 'Gentofte' },
      { id: '0159', name: 'Gladsaxe' },
      { id: '0173', name: 'Lyngby-TaarbÃ¦k' },
      { id: '0230', name: 'Rudersdal' }
    ]
  };
}
```
