> A list of zipcodes in denmark and associated information

## Installation

```

## Documentation

On installation this module will download two excel files and compile a
json file, containing cross referenced information.

The source is postdanmark:

* overview: http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Privat/Kundeservice/postnummerkort/Sider/postnummerkort.aspx
* zipcodes (full list): http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/postnummerfil-excel.xls
* zipcodes by regions (incomplete): http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/regionsopdelt-postnummer-excel.xls

Get the zipcodes by:

```javascript
zipcodes = require('denmark-zipcode')
```

This is a `Map` object, with zipcodes as keys and associated information
as values.

```javascript
for (let [zipcode, info] of zipcodes) {
  // zipcode is a number
  zipcode = 2800;

  // info is an object
  info = {
    zipcode: 2800,
    city: 'Kongens Lyngby',
    // This can be a string, if information was provided
    street: null,
    // This can be a string, if information was provided
    firm: null,
    province: true,
    // This can be null, if no cross referenced information was found
    region: { number: 1084, name: 'Region Hovedstaden' },
    // This can be an empty array, if no cross referenced information was found
    communes:
     [ { number: 230, name: 'Rudersdal Kommune' },
       { number: 173, name: 'Lyngby-TaarbÃ¦k Kommune' },
       { number: 159, name: 'Gladsaxe Kommune' },
       { number: 157, name: 'Gentofte Kommune' } ],
    // Possible values are ['Denmark', 'Greenland', 'Faroe Islands']
    country: 'Denmark'
  };
}
```
